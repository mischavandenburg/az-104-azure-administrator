# Study Notes for AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator

This repo contains my notes for the AZ-104 certification.

I also wrote a full [study guide](https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/az-104-study-guide/).

I spent 80 hours studying for this exam. 

There are two directories in this repo, "msdocs" and "other." The "msdocs" directory contains my notes and summaries of the Microsoft Learn modules. The "other" directory contains notes from YouTube videos and other supplemental resources I used. 

I especially needed to put in a lot of effort in Azure AD so the directory contains some extensive notes on that subject. 

# Anki Flash Cards

I use Anki for spaced repetition. I'm including an export of my Anki deck in this repo as well. You can find it in the "other" directory.

Throughout my notes, you will come across lines such as:

> Availability zone::Unique physical location within a region, made up of 1 or more datacenters. Combination of fault domain and update domain. 
ID: 1669745066209

These are actually Anki flash cards. I use Obsidian to take my notes and I run a plugin that generates flashcards from this syntax. The test before the "::" is the front of the card, and the rest is the back of the card.
